Product Advantages
==================

Advantages of Public NAT Gateways
---------------------------------

-  **Flexible deployment**

   A NAT gateway can be shared across subnets and AZs, so that even if an AZ fails, the public NAT gateway can still run normally in another AZ. The type and EIP of a public NAT gateway can be changed at any time.

-  **Ease of use**

   Multiple types of NAT gateways are available. Public NAT gateway configuration is simple, the operation & maintenance is easy, and they can be provisioned quickly. Once provisioned, they can run stably.

-  **Cost-effectiveness**

   Multiple servers can share an EIP. You can associate one or more EIPs with a public NAT gateway to allow multiple servers in a private network to connect to the Internet through this EIP. You no longer need to configure one EIP for each server, which saves money on EIPs and bandwidth.
