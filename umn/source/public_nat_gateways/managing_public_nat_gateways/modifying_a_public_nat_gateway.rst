Modifying a Public NAT Gateway
==============================

Scenarios
---------

You can modify the name, type, or description of a public NAT gateway.

Using a public NAT gateway of a larger type does not affect services, but if you switch to a public NAT gateway of a smaller type, make sure the reduced capacity will still be enough to meet your service requirements.

Prerequisites
-------------

There is a public NAT gateway available.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click **Service List** in the upper left corner. Under **Network**, select **NAT Gateway**.

   The **Public NAT Gateway** page is displayed.

#. On the displayed page, locate the row that contains the public NAT gateway you want to modify and click **Modify** in the **Operation** column.

#. Modify the name, type, or description of the public NAT gateway as needed.

#. Click **Next**.

#. Click **Submit**.
