Step 2: Assign an EIP
=====================

Scenarios
---------

You can assign an EIP, which can work together with a public NAT gateway to allow servers that are connected to the cloud using Direct Connect to access the Internet or provide services accessible from the Internet.

Procedure
---------

For details, see `Assigning an EIP <https://docs.sc.otc.t-systems.com/usermanual/eip/eip_0002.html>`__.

After obtaining the EIP, you do not need to bind it to a server.
