========

Public NAT gateways allow servers in your data center to access the Internet or to provide services accessible from the Internet. You need to first create a Direct Connect or VPN connection to connect your servers in an on-premises data center to the cloud, and then create public NAT gateways and configure SNAT or DNAT rules to obtain the required services. :ref:`Figure 1 <nat_qs_0013__fig27821032152616>` shows how servers in an on-premises data center communicate with the Internet.
