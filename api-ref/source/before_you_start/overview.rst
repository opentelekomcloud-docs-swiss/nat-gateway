Overview
========

Welcome to *NAT Gateway API Reference*. The NAT Gateway service provides the network address translation (NAT) function for servers, such as Elastic Cloud Servers (ECSs) in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). It also supports this function for servers that connect to a VPC through Direct Connect or Virtual Private Network (VPN) in local data centers. It allows these servers to access the Internet using elastic IP addresses (EIPs) or to provide services for the Internet.

This document describes how to use application programming interfaces (APIs) to perform operations on NAT gateways, such as creating or deleting NAT gateways, or adding SNAT rules. For details about all supported operations, see :ref:`API Overview <nat_api_0052>`.
